I made json files of primitive roots of prime numbers from 3 to 9973.

The purpose was to use it as a shortcut on the iPhone, but it may take a long time and time out depending on the device.

list      : The text-based upload of a description in json format.
root.json  : The same thing uploaded as a json file.
